# Edge Cases

Handle these gracefully. None should crash the review or silently skip work.

| Case                                        | Handling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empty diff**                              | Write a short report: "No changes to review for <confirmed scope>." Exit. Do not spawn workers.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **No PR found / invalid PR number**         | Re-ask the user for the correct scope. Do not guess or fall back to a different PR.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`gh auth` missing (PR-comments path)**    | Write the report anyway. Emit a clear error: "GitHub replies skipped: auth unavailable (<reason>). Report written to <path>. Replies can be posted manually." Do NOT silently skip.                                                                 |
| **Huge diff** (≈2000+ lines or ≈40+ files)  | **Sample**: summarize each file's diff-stat; pick representative files per category for deep review; note partial coverage explicitly in the appendix and flag that coverage is incomplete. Do not silently truncate.                               |
| **No skills found**                         | Proceed with general best-practices via web/docs MCPs. Note "no project skills located" in the appendix.                                                                                                                                            |
| **No conventions found**                    | Default to MoSCoW severity. Note "no project conventions located; using MoSCoW default" in the appendix.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Consensus 3-way deadlock**                | Top agent resolves; record the split in the dissenting block (see `.opencode/agent-resources/code-review/rules/consensus.md`).                                                                                                                      |
| **A worker fails / errors**                 | Note the failure and continue with sibling workers. Surface the failure in the appendix ("worker for <category> failed: <reason>; category reviewed inline/partially").                                                                             |
| **A consensus voter fails / errors**        | Majority of the RETURNED voters decides; see the voter-failure rules in `.opencode/agent-resources/code-review/rules/consensus.md`. Never silently drop the finding.                                                                                |
| **Path C scope is a single file**           | Still categorize it (it may span categories by content) and review inline if trivial; no diff exists to slice.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Sensitive data (secrets, PII) in diff**   | The `security-sensitive` category is always extracted. Reference sensitive content by `file:line` only - never quote secrets into findings or the report.                                                                                           |
| **Category with a single trivial file**     | Do not spawn a dedicated worker - review inline in the top agent or fold into the nearest category.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Cross-category overlap on the same file** | Merge the overlapping categories into one worker to avoid duplicate review of the same lines.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Tool / MCP unavailable**                  | Fall back per the resource bundle's `fallback_chain` (from the `resource-scout`); if the need wasn't covered, scan your own tool list for a configured MCP, then web search. Note in the appendix if a key source was unreachable.                  |
| **User declines auto-fix (Step 7)**         | Declining stops the auto-apply, but each declined item is recorded in the report's disposition section as declined-with-reason - never silently parked; the report stays unstaged; the user can apply fixes manually from the report.               |
| **software-engineer fails on a fix**        | software-engineer marks that fix `failed`/`skipped` and continues with siblings - it does not abort the batch. Surface every `failed`/`skipped` fix in the report's "Auto-applied fixes" section and to the user. Do not retry within the same run. |
| **Verify fails after fixes**                | Leave the applied fixes in place; record the failure (command + short file:line reference) in the "Auto-applied fixes" section. Do NOT auto-revert - the user decides whether to keep, adjust, or discard the changes.                              |

## Sampling rule (huge diff)

When sampling:

1. Compute diff-stat per file (lines added/removed).
2. Group files by detected category.
3. Within each category, pick files by: largest change, security-relevance, and
   representativeness of the change type.
4. Deep-review the sampled files; summarize the rest with a one-line note each.
5. State the sampling explicitly: "Sampled N of M files for deep review (diff
   exceeded threshold). Coverage: partial. Full review requires narrower scope."

# Category Detection

Derive review categories from the review set (the diff for Path A/B, or the scoped
file contents for Path C). Do NOT use a fixed category list - let the changes/files
dictate the categories. The table below maps signals to suggested categories; you may
invent a category when the review set warrants one not listed.

## Signal → category hints

| Signal | Suggested category |
|---|---|
| File extension → primary language | `language/<lang>` (e.g. language/python, language/rust) |
| Path `/test/`, `*Test*`, `*_test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/` | `tests` |
| Path `/migration*/`, `*.sql`, schema DDL keywords (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER`, `INDEX`) | `database` |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*`, `*.tf`, `.github/workflows/*`, CI config | `infra/ci` |
| `*.md`, `docs/*`, `README*`, `CHANGELOG*` | `docs` |
| `package.json`, `*.csproj`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, lockfiles | `dependencies` |
| `*.config.*`, `.env*`, `appsettings*`, config `*.yaml`/`*.yml` | `config` |
| Route/endpoint/controller definitions, OpenAPI specs | `api-contract` |
| Content: `password`, `secret`, `token`, `apiKey`, `private key`, `eval(`, `exec(`, `auth`, `crypto`, `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`, `bcrypt`, `jwt` | `security-sensitive` |

## Rules

- **Security-sensitive is ALWAYS its own category**, regardless of file type. It
  cross-cuts languages and layers. Extract it standalone even if the file also
  matches another category.
- A file may belong to multiple categories (e.g. a SQL migration touching auth →
  `database` + `security-sensitive`).
- **Collapse micro-categories.** If only one file maps to a given language or
  area, do not spawn a dedicated worker - fold it into the nearest related
  category or review it inline in the top agent.
- **Target 3–6 categories.** Fewer → review inline (no fan-out needed). More →
  fan out one worker per category.
- **Never echo secrets** into findings or the report. Reference sensitive content
  by `file:line` only.
- **Path C (static scope):** there is no diff, so signals come from the file paths
  and their current contents (content greps), not from changed lines. Review the
  whole file, not hunks.

## Output of this step

A category map for the report appendix:

```
category → [list of files]
```

This map drives the worker fan-out (Step 3) and is recorded in the final report's
"What was reviewed" appendix.
